# StudentsWebApi
The project I created is a Web API that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a database-first approach. This API serves as a robust backend system for managing data within the database.

Key Features:

Database-First Approach: The project follows a database-first approach, where an existing database schema is utilized as the foundation for generating the necessary models and data access layer.

RESTful API: The Web API adheres to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture, providing standardized endpoints for interacting with the database entities. It supports standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform the respective CRUD operations.

CRUD Operations: The API supports all fundamental CRUD operations, allowing users to create new records, retrieve existing records, update record details, and delete records from the database. These operations are executed securely and efficiently.

Scalability and Performance: The project is designed to handle a high volume of requests efficiently. It leverages best practices for performance optimization, such as caching, pagination, and query optimization, to minimize response times and maximize scalability.

By implementing this Web API with CRUD operations using a database-first approach, users can effortlessly interact with the database and manage data effectively. The API provides a reliable and secure solution for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data within the specified database, enabling seamless integration with various frontend applications and systems.
